# Devansh Somvanshi — Build Log

**Project:** Sidedoor, a product for job referrals in Indian tech hiring. Being re-done properly so the case study holds up in interviews.
**Started:** original work before this log existed (dates not recorded). This log started 17 Sep 2026.

## Where things stand

Bet:        employees drop strangers' referral requests because the request makes them do the candidate's work, not because they won't help (SCOPE v2, draft)
Evidence:   thin. 4 real interviews with 2 people (each as candidate and as referrer), 1 remembered follow-up, desk research without source links
Files:      SCOPE.md [x] v2 draft, v1 kept, landscape · BUSINESS.md [x] draft · BRIEF.md [x] AX Spec, plan draft · RESEARCH.md [x] notes, sort, five clusters, jobs, insights, three candidate problem statements · BRIEF.md [ ] · DESIGN_LANGUAGE.md [ ] · build [ ] Figma V2 exists, not a coded build · live [ ]
Rounds:     1. Mentor's critique (the product and referrer incentive). No change has come from it yet
Open:       business lens with sources, source links for desk research,
            live case study still shows AI-sourced quotes and screens that aren't in Figma
Next:       molades-language

CRITIQUE · undated, before this log · molades-attack · Source: facilitator
Finding:             Mentor: this would make more sense as a feature inside LinkedIn. Referrers have little reason to
                     join a brand-new app, so the product can't get its supply side.
Severity:            blocker
Layer:               the bet
Action:              rejected (17 Sep 2026), Devansh's call: Sidedoor stays its own product. Answered with reasoning in SCOPE.md v2, not tested

LEARNED · 17 Sep 2026 · molades-research
Believed:            The research base was 10 interviews: 2 recruiters, 4 referrers, 4 candidates.
Found:               Only 4 are real: Candidate 1, Candidate 2, Referrer 1 (Infosys), Referrer 2 (Accenture). The other
                     6 transcripts in FigJam were generated with AI.
Changed:             Only the 4 real transcripts are research now. Copied verbatim into raw/.
What this made worthless: every recruiter claim; the "40–50 DMs a day" PM; "I messaged 40 people, 9 replied, 3
                     submitted"; "system gets flooded when the bonus goes up"; the claim of 10 interviews on the live
                     case study; the affinity notes in FigJam, which can't be told apart by source.

DECISION · 17 Sep 2026 · molades-research
Decided:             Go ahead with the 4 real interviews and the desk research. No new interviews or survey.
Rejected:            Collecting more interviews (Devansh has no time); keeping the 6 generated transcripts as
                     "illustrative" (they would be invented evidence).
Because:             Thin data proceeds with its gaps named. Recruiters and referrers who ignore requests have no real
                     data, so anything about them is marked guessing.
How sure:            saw it

CRITIQUE · 17 Sep 2026 · molades-research · Source: AI
Finding:             The live case study's five solution screens (ranked referrer list, structured request form, four-level
                     recommendation, shared pipeline, request limits and ranked inbox) are not in Figma V2. V2 is a
                     swipe-to-match app: referrers post jobs, both sides swipe, a match opens chat, the referrer updates
                     stages by hand, and candidates can pay for Premium.
Severity:            blocker
Layer:               the bet
Action:              open. Settled in molades-brief, once the problem statement exists

CRITIQUE · 17 Sep 2026 · molades-research · Source: AI
Finding:             Two claims on the live case study walked back. "One PM got 40–50 DMs a day" traces to a generated
                     transcript. "Referrers aren't unwilling, they're uncertain" is contradicted by both real referrers
                     (n50, n55, n76, n77).
Severity:            major
Layer:               the bet
Action:              deferred to molades-case

CRITIQUE · 17 Sep 2026 · molades-research · Source: AI
Finding:             Desk research was done by Devansh with Perplexity, but no original source links were kept. Every
                     figure on the live page (5–10×, 29 days, 46% vs 33%, 15–25%, 191, 92%) will be asked "where is that
                     from?". The live page's "~20% cold DM reply rate" doesn't match the desk research (15–25%).
Severity:            major
Layer:               the bet
Action:              open. Devansh to add the original link for each figure in raw/desk-research.md

DECISION · 17 Sep 2026 · molades-synthesise
Decided:             91 numbered notes, one observation each, in the person's own words, with question numbers.
                     Every quoted phrase checked word for word against its transcript by script (75 phrases, 0 missing
                     after one fix). Participants referred to as "they" because the transcripts don't state gender.
Rejected:            Reusing the FigJam affinity stickies (no link to a person, and mixed with generated transcripts).
Because:             A numbered note in someone's own words is the only thing a problem statement can be walked back to.
How sure:            saw it

DECISION · 17 Sep 2026 · molades-scope
Decided:             SCOPE.md v1 written by copying Devansh's FigJam scope, hypotheses and North Star, labelled as
                     reconstructed. Notes sorted against its span: from asking an employee for a referral to knowing
                     what happened, up to the interview stage.
Rejected:            Writing a fresh v1 now (it would be a scope card made after the research, pretending to be before it).
Because:             Sorting needs a moment, and v2 has to be written against what the original bet actually said.
How sure:            saw it (copied from FigJam)

DECISION · 17 Sep 2026 · molades-synthesise
Decided:             Sort: 75 in scope, 3 out of scope (n39 n86 n88), 13 not a problem. Draft clusters: C1 strangers
                     don't see the request; C2 referrer drops or chases incomplete requests; C3 candidate can't tell
                     what happened; C4 referrer has little reason to refer a stranger. n91 parked. Each cluster has a
                     tension, what they did, a So what?, groups, two plain lines and a job to be done, as on the RedBus
                     artefacts page.
Rejected:            Six clusters, with "silence instead of a no" and "proving fit" on their own; both merged (see
                     RESEARCH.md, What was merged). Labels starting with "User", replaced by "Candidate" or "Referrer"
                     because Sidedoor has two kinds of user.
Because:             Draft by AI, not yet reviewed by Devansh.
How sure:            worked it out

CHANGE · 17 Sep 2026 · molades-synthesise
Changed:             "Proving fit" split back out of C2. Referrer-side fit checks (n50 n51 n53 n56 n63 n65 n82) stay in C2;
                     candidate-side notes (n11 n22 n23 n29) become C5, "Candidate can't tell how strong a fit they are
                     before they spend a request", marked THIN.
Caused by:           Devansh, 17 Sep 2026: "checking fit is mostly pain point of referrer, but candidates wud also like
                     to have it so that they can see the potential of them getting selected acc to fit".
Result:              Five clusters. Devansh also said many candidates tailor resumes to the job description because ATS
                     software filters on match. Not in the four transcripts or the desk research, so recorded in C5 as
                     guessing, not used as evidence.

DECISION · 17 Sep 2026 · molades-synthesise
Decided:             Draft jobs: C2 + C4 combine into J3 (referring a stranger for minutes), C1 + C5 into J1 (asking where
                     it will be read), C3 stays as J2 (knowing what happened). One insight statement each. Three
                     candidate problem statements: A referrer side, B candidate side, C both sides.
Rejected:            Keeping five separate jobs (two pairs are one job seen twice); combining jobs across the two sides
                     (a job has one "I").
Because:             Draft by AI, following the RedBus artefacts page (combine, then one insight per final job).
                     The choice between A, B and C is Devansh's.
How sure:            worked it out

DECISION · 17 Sep 2026 · molades-synthesise
Decided:             Problem statement: an employee asked for a referral by someone they don't know has to do the
                     candidate's work before they can say yes, so most don't, and the candidate never finds out.
                     Primary: the request makes the referrer do the candidate's work. Secondary: the answer never travels back.
Rejected:            A (referrer side only): ignores the candidate who never learns what happened. B (candidate side
                     only): describes symptoms, and rebuilds old Sidedoor.
Because:             Devansh: "A, B, C all are true". C holds A and B as its two sides. Devansh asked AI to choose; AI
                     gave its view and reason, Devansh agreed.
How sure:            saw it (what happens) · worked it out (why) · guessing (that a complete request gets referred more)
Traces to:           n70 n76 n77 n57 n59 n60 n71 n73 n75 n87 n62 n69 n01 n25 n34 n35 n36 n58 n83 n47 n64

LEARNED · 17 Sep 2026 · molades-scope
Believed:            Referrals break because of a trust gap: referrers can't judge strangers and fear for their reputation,
                     so they need match scores, graded recommendations and spam limits (old Sidedoor, FigJam problem statement).
Found:               The two real referrers already have simple rules and don't fear for their reputation (n50, n55, n76).
                     What stops them is the work a request hands them (n57, n59, n60, n70, n71, n76), for a low reward (n87).
The part that was wrong: "referrers cannot confidently evaluate unknown candidates"
This made worthless: the four-level recommendation screen, request limits, the ranked inbox, the "trust layer" as
                     the core bet, and swipe matching (no note supports it). The live case study's screens 03 and 05.
So now I believe:    Employees drop strangers' requests because the request makes them do the candidate's work.

DECISION · 17 Sep 2026 · molades-scope
Decided:             SCOPE.md v2 (draft): a feature inside LinkedIn. Moment: a candidate asking an employee they don't know
                     for a referral to one job, until they hear what happened. Number: % of those requests the employee
                     submits. Guardrail: employees turning off referral requests must not rise.
Rejected:            A new standalone app (both sides must join; referrers have little reason; Fishbowl's referral
                     communities are quiet, n28). A referrer-shared link as the home of the product (only helps after a
                     referrer agrees; kept as an idea).
Because:             All four already ask and get asked on LinkedIn (n04 n07 n09 n29 n49 n68 n69). Answers the mentor's
                     critique with the notes.
How sure:            saw it (where they ask) · guessing (the number and guardrail, no baseline)

CHANGE · 17 Sep 2026 · molades-scope
Changed:             SCOPE.md v2 rewritten: Sidedoor is its own product, not a feature inside LinkedIn. Added the
                     cold-start bet (referrers first use a link candidates fill in, n66) and a second kill condition.
Caused by:           Devansh, 17 Sep 2026: "I don't want it to be just a feature... Let's be confident that it can be a
                     new product... Through the business lens and product thinking lens, we will justify why this
                     product will work with proper reasoning, data, and research."
Result:              The mentor's critique is rejected, and the rejection has to be defended. AI said the risk once:
                     all four people ask on LinkedIn today, and Fishbowl's referral communities are quiet (n28).

DECISION · 17 Sep 2026 · molades-scope
Decided:             Sidedoor as its own product.
Rejected:            A feature inside LinkedIn (mentor's suggestion, and the earlier draft of v2).
Because:             Devansh's call. Supporting reasons: the work sits between LinkedIn and the company portal, which
                     neither owns (n46 n47 n57 n58 n59 n60 n71); referrers get value from the link before the network
                     exists (n66); both candidates asked for a dedicated place (n24 n45).
How sure:            worked it out (the reasons) · guessing (that referrers adopt it)

CRITIQUE · 17 Sep 2026 · molades-scope · Source: self
Finding:             Devansh reports a follow-up conversation with one interviewee, and the mentor's view that there is no
                     new reward for referrers. Proposed: the referrer's incentive is better candidates picked by an AI
                     engine, so they can refer for more roles and earn more bonuses; candidates get request limits and
                     skill-matched referral search.
Severity:            major
Layer:               the bet
Action:              saved as Idea 1–4 in SCOPE.md for molades-ai. Not evidence until the conversation is written down
                     (who, and what they said). Checked against the notes: the AI match is backed as a wish (n65, n23);
                     "more bonuses" is in tension with n87; request limits can't rest on spam (n19, n61).

DECISION · 17 Sep 2026 · molades-scope
Decided:             BUSINESS.md, built with the mentor's Product Anatomy slides (PAM04 L01–L04, PAM05 L03). Business
                     model: two-sided marketplace, referrers are the scarce side. Free for both sides first; companies pay
                     later; candidates may pay only for tools that help themselves. Strategy: quality-as-identity, every
                     request reaching a referrer is complete and a real fit. NSM: referrals submitted per active referrer
                     per month. Input metric: request-to-referral rate. Guardrail: referrers turning off requests or
                     leaving must not rise. Four loops: two acquisition, one engagement, one monetisation.
Rejected:            Candidates paying to see or reach referrers (V2 Premium; sells access to the scarce side, the
                     pay-to-play bias FigJam criticised). Referrers paying (kills supply). Ads (rewards time spent, the
                     opposite of a referral done in minutes). NSM candidates: sign-ups, requests sent, swipes or matches,
                     profile completion, messages sent (all vanity by the L02 checklist).
Because:             Devansh asked for the business side to be decided and included (17 Sep 2026). Applied the slides'
                     tools: the marketplace row of the model → pressure → design table, the four-question NSM checklist,
                     input vs output categories, the causal chain, and loop type with touchpoint and metric.
How sure:            worked it out (model, strategy, metrics) · guessing (that companies pay, and that the loops run)

CRITIQUE · 17 Sep 2026 · molades-scope · Source: AI
Finding:             Checked Figma V2 against the strategy (L04 "advance, neutral or contradict"). Contradicts: swipe cards
                     (built for volume), Premium paywall (sells access to referrers), referrer updating five stages by hand
                     (adds work to the scarce side). Advances: resume auto-fill, referrer JD upload, candidate tracking.
                     Neutral with risk: messaging.
Severity:            major
Layer:               the bet
Action:              deferred to molades-brief, flow by flow

LEARNED · 17 Sep 2026 · molades-research
Believed:            The 4 real transcripts were 4 different people: Candidate 1, Candidate 2, Referrer 1, Referrer 2.
Found:               They are 2 people. The Infosys employee is Candidate 1 and Referrer 1; the Accenture employee is
                     Candidate 2 and Referrer 2. Each was interviewed once as a candidate and once as a referrer.
                     (Devansh, 17 Sep 2026)
Changed:             Every file now names them by company and role ("Infosys (as candidate)"). The data check, bias line
                     and every "four people", "both candidates", "both referrers" corrected to two people. The
                     follow-up conversation (with the Infosys employee) added as n92, marked remembered.
What this made worthless: any claim that a pattern came from four people. The strongest patterns are now "both people".
                     Worth keeping: both have been on both sides of a referral.

CHANGE · 17 Sep 2026 · molades-research
Changed:             Participants named: Samarth (the Infosys employee, Candidate 1 and Referrer 1) and Riya (the Accenture
                     employee, Candidate 2 and Referrer 2). Labels in RESEARCH, SCOPE, BUSINESS and the raw transcript
                     headers now read "Samarth (as candidate)", "Riya (as referrer)". Earlier LOG entries keep the old labels.
Caused by:           Devansh, 17 Sep 2026: "You can mention the real name. Samarth is the candidate one and refer one. And
                     Riya is candidate 2 and refer 2."
Result:              Notes use real first names, as the rules ask. Not the same Samarth as in the RedBus research.

DECISION · 17 Sep 2026 · molades-scope
Decided:             Premium: candidates pay only for tools that help themselves (fit check before asking, profile
                     feedback). Never to reach, see or jump ahead of referrers. V2's Premium screen becomes a candidate tool.
Rejected:            Candidates paying to see who wants to refer them (V2 as designed); no candidate payment at all.
Because:             Devansh: "Whatever is correct and has proper reasoning behind it, so that I can explain and justify
                     it properly in interviews". AI's reasons: referrers are the scarce side and selling their attention
                     breaks the quality promise; paying doesn't change a referrer's rule (n50, n76, n77); candidate tools
                     raise request quality, which moves the North Star (n23, C5); companies already pay for referrals (n62, n87).
How sure:            worked it out · guessing (that candidates or companies will pay)

DECISION · 17 Sep 2026 · molades-landscape
Decided:             Landscape of LinkedIn, GetMeReferred, EasyRefer, Instahyre and no-product, from Devansh's screenshots
                     at full size plus GetMeReferred's pricing page. Convention: the ask is free text plus a resume; fit is
                     shown to candidates, and sold to them; nobody shows what happened to a referral. Sidedoor pursues
                     three gaps: the complete request, status passed on by the referrer, fit shown to the referrer.
Rejected:            Competing on discovery and candidate-side fit (LinkedIn already has "People you can reach out to" and
                     match details). "Nobody reads the company's status" as an opening (binding: no outside access, n46).
                     Free, unlimited reach as an opening (binding: open systems fill inboxes; GetMeReferred uses price).
                     Jumbl, left out (screens show an internship marketplace, not referrals).
Because:             The skill's question, "what do they know that we don't?", asked of every gap.
How sure:            saw it (screens) · worked it out (reasons, pricing page)

LEARNED · 17 Sep 2026 · molades-landscape
Believed:            Sidedoor could win on discovery (ranked referrers) and on showing candidates their fit.
Found:               LinkedIn already puts "People you can reach out to" and "Show match details" on every job, and
                     GetMeReferred already lists willing, verified referrers.
The part that was wrong: "candidates find relevant referrers"
This made worthless: the old case study's Screen 01 as a differentiator; Idea 4 as a reason to exist.
So now I believe:    Sidedoor's reason to exist is what nobody does: a request that arrives complete, status the referrer
                     passes on, and fit shown to the referrer.

DECISION · 17 Sep 2026 · molades-ai
Decided:             AX Spec draft 1 in BRIEF.md. The model does two jobs: resume and job description into fields (both
                     sides), and ordering a referrer's requests by fit with the reasons shown. Level: the model does it,
                     the person checks, for both. Surface: Idea 6 (list ordered by fit, "Lower match" collapsed but
                     referable) with Idea 5 (fit breakdown on each card) and Idea 7 (portal-ready panel), plus Idea 9
                     (the referrer's own rule). Controls: where did this come from, why did it do that, override. No
                     single fit score; counts instead.
Rejected:            The model just does it (hiding or auto-declining low fits: silence for candidates, a decision under
                     the referrer's name, and Samarth refers borderline matches on purpose, n53). Arrival order with
                     suggestions only. Idea 10, one-at-a-time swipe (volume). Idea 12 as the main surface (slow). A chat
                     box. Generating the candidate's message (n76 n77; the landscape's do-not-inherit). Predicting hire chance.
Because:             Draft by AI following the skill; Devansh's n92 idea kept as ordering, not hiding.
How sure:            worked it out · every material fact guessing

DECISION · 17 Sep 2026 · molades-ai · Source: self
Decided:             Lower-match requests stay visible to the referrer, collapsed under "Lower match", and can still be referred.
Rejected:            Hiding them completely (Devansh's earlier "only showing curated candidates").
Because:             Devansh: "visible but collapsed". Reasons given: a hidden request is silence for the candidate (C3),
                     and Samarth refers borderline matches on purpose (n53).
How sure:            worked it out

DECISION · 17 Sep 2026 · molades-brief
Decided:             Shape: its own app for both sides, with a no-install link page as the way in for strangers. Words from
                     the interviews: referral request, job ID, portal, match, and five stages (Submitted, In interviews,
                     On hold, Selected, Not selected) in their portals' words. 16 screens; main path 8 steps across two
                     people, ending when the candidate sees "Submitted". Every V2 flow marked keep, change or cut.
Rejected:            The link page alone (can't hold status over weeks, n44 n45). A LinkedIn change (Devansh, 17 Sep).
                     V2's swipe cards (volume), "Referral Accepted" match screens (not the finish), six manual stages
                     (work for the scarce side), four-step manual creation (the document already fills it), referrers
                     browsing candidates who didn't ask (consent the research never touched), a long message box (n76).
Because:             Tied to C2 (complete request), C3 (status back), C4 (referrer effort), and the landscape's gaps.
How sure:            worked it out

CRITIQUE · 17 Sep 2026 · molades-brief · Source: self
Finding:             Main path step 7, the referrer coming back to tap "I've submitted it on my portal". Devansh: "i think
                     most referrers wont do this. why wud they care to update this for candidate". The status loop
                     depended on the scarce side doing unpaid work (C4).
Severity:            major
Layer:               steps
Action:              fixed. "Mark as submitted" is now the last tap of the Refer task, and clears the referrer's own list.
                     The candidate can confirm it from the company's automated email (n72 n47). Main path 8 → 7 steps.
                     NSM now counts a referral confirmed by either side (BUSINESS.md).

DECISION · 2026-09-17 · molades-language
Decided:   Keep V2's language (Inter, 4 sizes, 12/8/4 radius, soft shadows, blue #2563EB action, green #10B981 brand). Density "between": lists dense (3 requests + actions in one screen), forms spacious. Blue only means "tap". Status colour by meaning: Sent neutral, progress green, On hold amber, Not selected neutral.
Rejected:  V2 success/error/amber text colours (low contrast), second blue #007AFF, decimal fit score, swipe, gold Premium button, all-caps SIGN UP, blue "Under Review" tag.
Because:   The referrer decides on a work break, so the list has to show enough requests at once. "Not selected" is an outcome, not an error, so it is not red. Two colours for one meaning, or one colour for two meanings, makes status unreadable.
How sure:  worked it out

LEARNED · 2026-09-17 · molades-language
Rounds run:      4
Biggest gap between round 1 and final:  density. The fit line "(you need 2–5)" wrapped and made each card about 25% taller than V2's. Second: blue was doing two jobs (button and status).
Did not close:   nothing on the 6 dimensions. The tone adjectives are a draft until Devansh confirms them.

DECISION · 2026-09-17 · molades-language
Decided:   Short on list screens, detailed on the single request screen.
Rejected:  One density everywhere.
Because:   On the list the referrer is scanning. On one request they are deciding whether to put their name on a stranger, so they need to see where each fact came from.
How sure:  worked it out (Source: self)

DECISION · 2026-09-17 · molades-build
Decided:   Existing V2 screens stay untouched. All screens are copied below them after a gap, and changes happen only in the copies.
Because:   V2 is kept as a backup and shown as an iteration in the case study.
How sure:  saw it (Source: self)
